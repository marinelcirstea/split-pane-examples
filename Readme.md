# React and Vanilla JS Split Pane

### Why?

Because I don't want to install libraries for something so simple..

#### Don't want to browse the files? Here's the TLDR:

There's 2 examples for both vanilla js and react.

One is using an input with range, the other one is using a bar
in the middle(in between the component's children)

I've also added the option to reverse the children and an option to refresh
when resizing the window. Remove them if you want.

If you remove all the optional stuff and the comments, the
whole component is probably 50 lines of code(mostly jsx/html).

### How?

Clone the repo

#### React

```sh
git clone git@github.com:marinelcirstea/split-pane-examples.git
```

##### Optional

If you already have an existing project, just copy the component(s).

Otherwise:

```sh
cd with-react
```

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```

#### HTML

Just open the html files in a browser.
